## 🎸 Hi all 🎸

My name is Léandre, I'm a french developper.

I'm a student at Epitech Technology, based in Lyon.

You'll find in my repositories some fun projects !

Most of projects in C langage are my version of Epitech's project.

I also tried doing some Rust, Python, JavaScript and some HTML/CSS.


#### ⚠️ If you're an Epitech Student, you can check what i've done in some of my Epitech projects, but as you migth know, cheating on my code will provide you a  -42. Sure you can check for logical purposes but nothing much 😉
